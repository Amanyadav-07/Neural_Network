# Neural Network Guide

## Overview
This repository contains both **theoretical explanations** and **practical implementations** of neural networks. It is designed to help understand the fundamentals of deep learning and how to apply them using Python and TensorFlow/Keras.

## Contents
### 1. Neural_Network_Theory.ipynb
- Provides a detailed explanation of neural networks, covering:
  - What neural networks are and how they work.
  - Different types of neural networks.
  - Activation functions, loss functions, and optimizers.
  - Forward and backward propagation.
  - Weight initialization, gradient problems, and solutions.
  
### 2. Neural_Network_Practical_Implementation.ipynb
- Demonstrates how to build and train neural networks using Keras.
- Covers:
  - Creating a simple perceptron.
  - Implementing a neural network with one hidden layer.
  - Using Xavier (Glorot) initialization.
  - Applying different activation functions and dropout for regularization.
  - Visualizing training progress with accuracy/loss curves.
  - Gradient clipping and custom loss functions.
